## Routing and Authentication in React with React Router

## Routing

- `React Router` is the standard routing library for React. It enables single-page applications (SPAs) to navigate between views or components without reloading the page.

- `BrowserRouter`: Root of your routing configuration
- `Routes`: Set Route from the current location
- `Route`: Couples URL segments to components, and also enables data loading & mutation
- `Outlet`: Placeholder for nested route content
- `Link`: The Link component is used to navigate between routes in a React application without reloading the page.
- `NavLink`: Use NavLink to apply styles when a link is active.
